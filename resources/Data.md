* In the standard case for a room with closed windows, we assume a passive indoor air volume exchange rate of 0.35 hr-1
* a respiration rate of 10 L/min is representative for a person between being at rest and performing light activity
* we assume that the emitted droplets initially have an effective average diameter of 5 µm, quickly shrinking to aerosol particles to around 1 µm in ambient air.
* we adopt characteristic particle number concentrations of 0.06 cm-3 for breathing, 0.6 cm-3 for speaking,
* Here we focus on the phase when subjects are particularly infectious, and find that this represents a fraction of about one fifth of the positive-tested patients, during which they have a mean viral load of about 5×108 mL-1 (i.e. within the range 108–109 mL-1). This range was found to occur somewhat more frequently in the Swiss compared to the German data. We use this estimate to define the category “_highly infectious_”. Between five and ten percent of positive-tested subjects had an even higher mean viral load of about 5×109 mL-1, which is adopted for the category “_super infectious_” (i.e. more than 109 mL-1)
* **3.4. Virus lifetime in aerosol** - 1.7h
